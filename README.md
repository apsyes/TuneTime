# TuneTime
ENGR103 Final Project - Game
The goal of the game is to light the 10 neo pixels by imputing the correct button. The correct button is dictated by either a high or low tone played. As the game progresses, the time to press gets shorter. Once the game is won, a short tune is played and the game restarts.

Controlls:
- Low tone = Left Button
- High tone = Right Button
